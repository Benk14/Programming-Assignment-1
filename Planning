Problem: Make a Program that finds the volume and the surface area of a given 3D shape and dimensions of the shape


Prototype:
What is your shape?
Cube
Thanks what is the length of the sides in cm?
2
The volume of the cube is 8cm^3 and the surface area is 24cm^2.
Would you like to know the volume and surface area of another shape?
Yes
What is your shape?
Triangular Prism
What is the length of the larger rectangular side?
4
Thanks, what is the length of the smaller rectangular side?
2
Thanks, What is the height of the triangular side?
4
Thanks, The volume is 16cm^3 and the surface area is 32cm^2
Would you like to know the volume and surface area of another shape?
No
Thanks have a good day!


Pseudocode:
1. Declare variables.
2. Create a new scanner
3. Begin main part of code asking for what shape the user wants uses an if statement/case statement to determine which method to use
4. Jump to the proper shape within the if/case statement and then ask for all the required side lengths if a cube ask for 1, if a triangular prism ask for 3 etc
5. When all the side lengths are input then run jump to the proper method to determine the surface area and volume
6. Return values to the user
7. Ask if the user wants to run the program again
8. If the user answers yes then jump to step 3. If no then thank the user and then end the program.
